AI/ML Tool for Antibody Design and Molecular Property Prediction

# AI/ML Tool for Antibody Design

## Overview
This project implements an AI/ML tool designed to predict molecular properties based on antibody sequences. By utilizing machine learning techniques, the tool aims to streamline the discovery and development of biologics, particularly in antibody design.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and prepares datasets for analysis.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implements models for molecular property prediction, utilizing Random Forest as a baseline.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Visualizes multi-dimensional datasets to identify trends and insights.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Calculates model performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE).
- **Visualization**: Provides graphical representation of model predictions against actual values.
